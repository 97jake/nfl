# NFL Data Analysis

When a group of football-loving, Applied Math majors came across a data set in Kaggle published by the NFL containing data from every frame from every play from every
game in the 2018 NFL season, we knew we had to get our hands dirty. 

This repository is dedicated to all the work that Jake Snow, Scout Callens, Hunter Lybbert, and Jeremy Rawlings have done on the aforementioned NFL Kaggle data set. The main
goal is to use machine learning and other data anlytic techniques to find patterns hidden in this extensive data.

These files also showcase some methods for utilyzing webscrapping to pull important data from the ESPN website usingthe BeautifulSoup library. 


OvertimeAnalysis.py contains important functions for gathering relevant data from ESPN for use in analysis.
